  # Enable BinAuth Support.
  # If set, a program is called with several parameters on authentication (request) and deauthentication.
  # Request for authentication:
  # $<BinAuth> auth_client <client_mac> '<username>' '<password>'
  #
  # The username and password values may be empty strings and are URL encoded.
  # The program is expected to output the number of seconds the client
  # is to be authenticated. Zero or negative seconds will cause the authentification request
  # to be rejected. The same goes for an exit code that is not 0.
  # The output may contain a user specific download and upload limit in KBit/s:
  # <seconds> <upload> <download>
  #
  # Called on authentication or deauthentication:
  # $<BinAuth> <*auth|*deauth> <incoming_bytes> <outgoing_bytes> <session_start> <session_end>
  #
  # "client_auth": Client authenticated via this script.
  # "client_deauth": Client deauthenticated by the client via splash page.
  # "idle_deauth": Client was deauthenticated because of inactivity.
  # "timeout_deauth": Client was deauthenticated because the session timed out.
  # "ndsctl_auth": Client was authenticated manually by the ndsctl tool.
  # "ndsctl_deauth": Client was deauthenticated by the ndsctl tool.
  # "shutdown_deauth": Client was deauthenticated by Nodogsplash terminating.
