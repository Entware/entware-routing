    bird1-openwrt: use a single Makefile for IPv4 and IPv6 packages
    
    Having two Makefile files, respectively in the bird1-openwrt-ipv4 and
    bird1-ipv6-openwrt folders, made the CI tests fail at the time of
    building the packages, due to a compilation error. This patch merges
    both Makefile files into a single one. As a result, package compilation
    succeeds during the CI tests.
