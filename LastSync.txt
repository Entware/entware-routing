    bird3: add new bird3 package
    
    This commit introduces the `bird3` package to OpenWrt's routing feed.
    The package is primarily based on the existing `bird2` package, with
    minor modifications to accommodate the updates and changes in BIRD
    3.0.0. I have also added myself as the maintainer for this package.
    
    BIRD 3.0.0 is a major release that brings multithreading support,
    enabling better performance for protocols like BGP, BMP, RPKI, and
    others. The internal rework has introduced significant changes to the
    table and channel implementations, while protocol-level functionality
    remains largely consistent with BIRD 2.16. Although there are minor
    breaking changes in configuration and CLI, most existing setups should
    be reusable.
    
    Memory usage has increased in this version, with improvements planned
    for subsequent releases. Migration documentation is available in
    `doc/migration-bird3.md` from the official BIRD repository.
